# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project, I started by running an Auto ML experiment with the classification task on the Bankmarketing dataset. Then, I deploy the best model from the run, with logging and application insights enabled for monitoring and explanability. Next, I hosted swagger locally to view the available HTTP API methods and responses. The `endpoint.py` script was used to interact with the API, returning the modelâ€™s predictions in JSON format. Finally, I created and published a pipeline using the Bankmarketing dataset and the AutoML module, and consumed the pipeline endpoint.

### 3. Swagger Documentation and Consuming Endpoints
- Swagger runs on localhost showing the HTTP API methods and responses for the model

- endpoint.py  script runs against API producing JSON output from model

### 4. Create, Publish and Consume a Pipeline
- Pipeline has been created
