# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project, I started by running an Auto ML experiment with the classification task on the Bankmarketing dataset. Then, I deploy the best model from the run, with logging and application insights enabled for monitoring and explanability. Next, I hosted swagger locally to view the available HTTP API methods and responses. The `endpoint.py` script was used to interact with the API, returning the modelâ€™s predictions in JSON format. Finally, I created and published a pipeline using the Bankmarketing dataset and the AutoML module, and consumed the pipeline endpoint.

## Key Steps
### 1. Create and run Auto ML Experiment
- Bankmarketing Dataset uploaded to ML Studio

### 2. Deploy the best model
- Best model deployed.

-  Enabled application insights.

### 3. Swagger Documentation and Consuming Endpoints
- Swagger runs on localhost showing the HTTP API methods and responses for the model

- endpoint.py  script runs against API producing JSON output from model

### 4. Create, Publish and Consume a Pipeline
- Pipeline has been created
  
- Pipeline endpoint
  
- Bankmarketing dataset with AutoML module
  
- 'Published pipeline overview' showing a REST endpoint and a status of ACTIVE
  
- In Jupyter Notebook, showing that 'Use RunDetails Widget' shows the step runs
  
- In ML Studio showing scheduled run
